//TWIN WHEELER MODIFIED FOR ARDUINO SIMPLIFIED SERIAL PROTOCOL TO SABERTOOTH V2
//J. Dingley  For Arduino 328 Duemalinove or similar with a 3.3V accessory power output
//i.e. the current standard Arduino board.
//2nd April 2010
//small bugs fixed. Now uses second gyro to maintain a constant rate of turn in degrees per second
//I have now built this as a skateboard with 24V lead acid batteries, 2x250Watt motors and Razor E100 chain driven wheels
//and it balances and turns fine with me standing on top of it.
